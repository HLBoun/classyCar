Critical Thinking Program 4.
Car Class:


Requirements:
    
    Class named 'Car' that has the following member var:
       
        yearModel - int
        make - string
        speed - int

    Constructor
    Accessor method
    'accelerate' method that adds 5 to the 'speed' member when it is called
    'brake' method that subtracts 5 from the 'speed' member
    
    Demonstrate the class by calling the 'accelerate' method 5 times, then outputting the current speed.
    Call the 'brake' method 5 times, then output the current speed.



First Thoughts:
    
    Honestly, it seems straight forward. Create the class,
    then create an object with a 'make' & 'model'. Make a 
    function that calls the proper methods 5x. Should 
    probably make a function that allows the user to specify
    the make and model.

Real Steps:

    0.) At the top of the paper goes my name...with the date!
    1.) Create the 'Car' class.
    2.) Add the ^above members
    3.) Create a function that greets a user and allows them to specify which make and model. 
    4.) Make sure step 3 uses the contructor.
    5.) Make ea function that calls the 'brake' & 'accelerate' methods 5x & and prints the 'speed' each time.
